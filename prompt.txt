using the template in c:\dev\ai-templates, generate a website for podcast distribution using s3 and cloudfront.  The
  website should have an admin page that you can log into and trigger scanning the s3 bucket for new pod casts, and
  altering of pod cast description.  every hour a lambda should scan the s3 bucket for new pod casts and automatically
  add them unless they are marked hidden in the admin tool.  commit and build, review the pipeline output for errors,
  remediate any errors and continue doing this until the pipeline runs without error.  use us-east-1.
